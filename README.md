# substratum
Something that underlies or serves as a basis or foundation.

## About
This is a base script with built in 'best practices' I've learned over the years. The script outputs all activity to a `logs/` directory, features debugging option on the base variables section, and has an open _main_ fuction for you to add functionality.

## Usage
* REVIEW script variables
* ADD needed utilities or commands to the _prefight_ function, script will verify they're available and in the user's `$PATH`
* ADD tasks or commands to run to the _main_ function to make it do what you want
* DIRECT output to the `work/` directory for artifacts if needed
